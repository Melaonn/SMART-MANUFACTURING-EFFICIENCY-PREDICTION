Smart Manufacturing Machines Efficiency Prediction with GitOps, ArgoCD & Jenkins
An industrial-grade machine learning solution for predicting manufacturing machine efficiency using GitOps principles. This project demonstrates modern DevOps practices with ArgoCD for continuous deployment, Jenkins for CI/CD orchestration, and Infrastructure as Code for scalable manufacturing analytics.
Overview
This project predicts manufacturing machine efficiency in real-time using IoT sensor data, production metrics, and historical performance patterns. The implementation follows GitOps methodology with ArgoCD managing Kubernetes deployments and Jenkins handling the complete CI/CD pipeline for industrial-scale machine learning operations.
